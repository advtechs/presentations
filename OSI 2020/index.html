### Summary

1. CAL extends copyleft to user data
  * Also fixes some issues with AGPL, such as software without UI.
2. Copyleft for microservice architecture is a valid concept.
3. Copyleft for patents
  * Not just essential claims!

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->
