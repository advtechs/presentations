This code at end of impress.js, should remain in core. It's not about navigation.
        // rescale presentation when window is resized
        window.addEventListener("resize", throttle(function () {
            // force going to active step again, to trigger rescaling
            api.goto( document.querySelector(".step.active"), 500 );
        }, 250), false);
